Single Page App w/React?

Display:
=======
I'm a fan of the 1/2 - 2/3 height, 100% width image for the homepage (jumbotron in bootstrap, I think), minimal text

Colors? I think Spotify Green should be featured

Name, 
snippet of about Know.More, maybe carousel more info to avoid crowding the homepage
and buttons to move to the next view

I would like to try to use 'position: sticky' to create a neat scrolling display, e.g. there is a "header" graphic that scrolls with everything else until it reaches the top of the page and then it sticks to identify which section you are reading currently. Use x-index to ensure the graphc remains on top of scrolling text.

I would also ilke to try a fixed element for an important message, such as Please Register Now
